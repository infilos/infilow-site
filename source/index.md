# Hexo Doc Theme
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/hexo-theme-doc.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/hexo-theme-doc)

hexo-theme-doc is a **documentation theme** for [Hexo](https://hexo.io/), the fast and powerful blog framework powered by Node.js. It differs from other Hexo themes by allowing you to present documentationâ€”especially REST API documentation.

Created by JavaScript/Node.js developers, hexo-theme-doc capitalizes on Hexo's [extensibility](https://hexo.io/api/) and system of plugins for adding custom tags, customizing layouts, and processing multiple kinds of sources, which makes generating static websites simpler than other tools.

**hexo-theme-doc's features** include:

* A clean and responsive layout
* Search
* [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) integration
  * Support for [Swagger UI](https://zalando-incubator.github.io/hexo-theme-doc/usage-and-configuration/swagger-ui.html)
  * Ability to generate [beautiful HTML API references](https://zalando-incubator.github.io/hexo-theme-doc/usage-and-configuration/swagger-to-html.html) *(this feature is in beta phase)*.
* Simple, configurable navigation, including for Tables of Contents
* Google Analytics
* Customizable logo and favicon

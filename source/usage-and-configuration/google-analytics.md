# Google Analytics

Update your `_config.yml` file by adding/updating the `google_analytics` property with your tracking ID.

```yaml
theme_config:
  google_analytics: your-tracking-id
```

> On localhost, the google_analytics snippet will not be included to prevent sending dummy data while you are working on your local machine.
